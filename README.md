SCENARIOS


Justin scenario:

Justin and his older brother, John, come home from school one day, (John a sophomore at Canyon High School, Justin a 4th grade student at Nohl Canyon Elementary). John being the older child he has earned more freedom and responsibility, no longer having to do homework in a common living area. After turning on his machine and opening a browser, John feels like he does not want to do his homework immediately. Due to his gaming consoles being in the family room he cannot play his usual games until later. John points his browser to glizzy.io to relax before getting to work.

Justin being younger does not have the same freedom as his older brother, but being much younger his school work is much less time consuming and he is able to finish relatively quickly. Upon finishing, Justin starts up the family computer and heads to the browser based game that his brother just showed him earlier. 

Jazz Scenario:

Jazz is a 16 year old teenage girl, she attends high school at a high school in Nevada. One day at school she had a computer lab for one of her classes and she was sitting next to a couple of classmates that turned on a fun looking game on their browsers. She asked them what game that was, being a gamer herself, and they told her it is 'glizzy.io' a new game that just recently got put up. She played a bit during the lab, but eventually had to get to doing the lab work.

Later that day Jazz came back home and hopped on her laptop and looked up the game and joined into a lobby. Jazz played game after game looking for a win. She enjoyed the way that it was set-up as a battle royale with all the players put into a free-for-all, but what she enjoyed most was the idea that it was based on hot dogs which she found funny and amusing.

Tanner Scenario:

Tanner is a 13 year old middle schooler in New York, New York. He went to school one day and a couple of his peers in his class had their laptops and were playing a funny looking hot dog game. Tanner went up to them and asked them what they were playing and they said glizzy.io a new game that just dropped. Not having a laptop or a family computer at home, Tanner attempted to play on a school computer in the school's library. He played one game and got caught by the librarian because one of the rules of using a library computer is to not play games on it. After being caught he left the library and ran into his friend Jim. Jim asked if Tanner wanted to hang out later, and Tanner agreed to the invitation. 

After school ended, Tanner and Jim walked back to Jim's house. And once they walked in Tanner asked if Jim had a laptop or computer. Jim said "ya why", and Tanner talked about the fun new game he found. Jim was interested in it also after hearing Tanner's description and grabbed his laptop while showing Tanner to the family computer. They both logged on and started playing the game.
