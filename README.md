PRODUCT VISION


Glizzy.io is FOR kids to teenagers (5~18 years old) WHO enjoy casual online multiplayer games. THE Glizzy.io website features a goofy browser based battle royale game THAT allows users to anonymously combat one another by controlling hotdog characters. UNLIKE other battle royale games Glizzy.io is browser based, which allows players easy access to the game.  Further, Glizzy.io features character classes, allowing users to play as one of many hotdog characters from broughts to the classic frank.  Each character class uses different strengths and weaknesses which allows Glizzy.io to accomodate many different play styles and strategies. Lastly, Glizzy.io uses a non-violent combat system where users can fire off projectiles (ex. ketchup, mustard, relish) at other players while using their bun as an active shield against opponent's attacks. To keep the fun going, users may repair their bun by finding bread crumbs scattered across the game map.

PERSONAS


Elementary Schooler Persona 

Justin, aged 8, is a 4th grade student. He has an older brother who is in high school. Justin looks up to his brother, and his brother like many teenage boys enjoys spending his time playing video games. Justinâ€™s family lives in the suburbs, his dad works while his mom stays at home looking after him and his brother. Justin watches his brother play his video games but because he is so much younger their mother will not let Justin play all the same games that his older brother plays. The games that Justin is allowed to play are non-violent and child friendly. Justin also does not have his own device to play the games on. Instead, he has to use the shared family computer. After finishing his homework, Justin is allowed an hour of video games on the family computer. Because the family computer is older and lacks the power needed for large games, Justin enjoys playing simple browser based games. 

High Schooler Persona 

Jazz, aged 17, is in her Junior year in high school. Jazz is an avid video game player and has played video games since she was 8. Jazz picked up gaming when her dad brought home a PS2. Having a younger brother, Jazz would have to share time on the console with her brother. So, when Jazz got her first laptop, she began to play browser games. After a while she began to get bored of the browser games as they started to turn bland and were not as fun as she used to think they were. So to pass the time Jazz was wondering where she could find a new game that stepped up to the standard of what she wanted out of a fun browser game. 

Middle Schooler Persona 

Tanner is a 13 year old middle school student living in the Seattle area.  Between school and sports, Tanner's days are busy.  He leaves for school by 7 am and doesn't return home until track practice finishes.  After the stress of the long busy day at school and sports, Tanner likes to unwind by playing some video games with his friends.  Tanner's family has a console connected to the TV in their living room.  While playing on the console, Tanner often wishes to have more privacy so he can talk to his friends through his microphone headset openly without his whole family listening.  Tanner tried seeking privacy by playing computer games in his bedroom using his older brother's laptop.  The problem is the laptop is almost completely out of disk space, so he is unable to download any games he likes.  He finds himself wishing there was some game he could play remotely with friends that didn't require an install, like a browser based game.

SCENARIOS


Justin scenario:

Justin and his older brother, John, come home from school one day, (John a sophomore at Canyon High School, Justin a 4th grade student at Nohl Canyon Elementary). John, being the older child, has earned more freedom and responsibility, no longer having to do homework in a common living area. After turning on his machine and opening a browser, John feels like he does not want to do his homework immediately. Due to his gaming consoles being in the family room he cannot play his usual games until later. John points his browser to glizzy.io to relax before getting to work.

Justin being younger does not have the same freedom as his older brother, but being much younger his school work is much less time consuming and he is able to finish relatively quickly. Upon finishing, Justin starts up the family computer and heads to the browser based game that his brother just showed him earlier. 

Jazz Scenario:

Jazz is a 16 year old teenage girl, she attends high school at a high school in Nevada. One day at school she had a computer lab for one of her classes and she was sitting next to a couple of classmates that turned on a fun looking game on their browsers. She asked them what game that was, being a gamer herself, and they told her it is 'glizzy.io' a new game that just recently got put up. She played a bit during the lab, but eventually had to get to doing the lab work.

Later that day Jazz came back home and hopped on her laptop and looked up the game and joined into a lobby. Jazz played game after game looking for a win. She enjoyed the way that it was set-up as a battle royale with all the players put into a free-for-all, but what she enjoyed most was the idea that it was based on hot dogs which she found funny and amusing.

Tanner Scenario:

Tanner is a 13 year old middle schooler in Redmond, Washington. One day at school a couple of his classmates had out their laptops and were playing a funny looking  game with hotdogs. Curious, Tanner went up to them and asked them what they were playing. Inbetween laughs, they said the game was called glizzy.io.  It was a new game that just dropped. Not having his own laptop or a family computer at home, Tanner attempted to play on a computer in the school's library. He played one game and was hooked! The game's hotdog characters were hilarious! Unfortunatly Tanner was forced to log off by the librarian because one of the rules of the library computers is no games. After being caught he left the library and ran into his friend Jim. Jim asked if Tanner wanted to hang out later, and Tanner agreed to the invitation. 

After school ended, Tanner and Jim walked back to Jim's house. The whole way home Tanner couldn't stop telling Jim about the funny new game he found.  Jim was skeptical but listened anyways. Once they made it to Jim's house Tanner asked if Jim had a laptop or computer so he could show him the game. Jim obligingly went and fetched Tanner his laptop. Tanner quickly opend a browser program and typed in the URL.  In no time, the boys were completly absorbed, laughing hysterically.  After a few rounds of the game, Jim set Tanner up on his family's shared computer so that they could play together.
